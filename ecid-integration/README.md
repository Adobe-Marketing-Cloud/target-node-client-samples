# ECID integration sample

Although using the Target Node.js SDK for fetching content from Target can be powerful, the added value of using ECID
for user tracking outweighs using Target only. ECID allows leveraging all the cool features of the Adobe Experience Cloud,
such as audience sharing, analytics integration, etc.  
Using Target and ECID in an `Express` application is pretty straightforward. ECID has a client-side part, so we'll have 
to use a simple template that references the ECID client-side JavaScript library.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Start: `npm start`
