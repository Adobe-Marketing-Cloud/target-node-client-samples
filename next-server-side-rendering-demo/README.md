# Target server-side rendering with Next.js sample

A simple TargetClient SDK usage in server-side rendering demo, based on the Next.js sample app.  
Target offers are prefetched on the server-side and included in the rendered page, thus enabling instant application
of Target offers on the client side, without any additional Target calls initiated by Target client at.js library. 

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Dev build: `npm run dev`
3. Prod build: `npm run build && npm start`
